* buffer-stack-{down,up}, i'd like to ignore non-file buffers
* when tiling window to right and it cannot go right anymore, move window to next monitor
** Tile window to left
** Tile window to right
* have tabs of open buffers under header like in Eclipse
* if H-<key> doesn't exist, fallback to C-<key>
* Themes
** ToAcquire
*** lush
*** monokai

* Bookmarks
** automatic bookmarks
** line nums only in file buffers
* dictionary
* swap symbols and numbers
* Snippets
** snippet to kill ring C-x j M-w
* tags
** tagged files
* autocomplete yasnippets
* remap the useless/redundant mouse buttons to Ctrl or something?
* try to consolidate all these shit .el files
* gives unsaved lines a different background
* have tab autocomplete like clojure-mode has
* Caps_Lock and hyper key stuff

** instead of the key-chord stuff, use maybe vi macros?
** keys
*** Caps_Lock 66
*** Control_L 37 0xffe3
*** XF86Calculator 148
*** Katakana 98
*** XF86AudioPrev 173
*** Escape 9
*** keycode 108 (keysym 0xffea, Alt_R)
** other ideas
*** turn caps lock into start of a vi-macro.
*** caps caps - Caps Lock*
*** caps v - switch to vi-mode
*** remap CAPSLOCK to some weird symbol.  make that symbol the beginning point of a key-chord or some ivper key combo
*** give "Calc" key CapsLock function, make CapsLock Ctrl
* TODO when using symbol-row instead of numbers, indicate it in mode-line
* unbound evil VIM keys
** q
** g
* done Fixed
** viper exit replace mode w/o spitting out "q"
*** stopped using key-chord.  this is bound to H-i & C-; now
** I don't like H-b & H-m-b for the switch buffer thing.  maybe H-8 & H-m-8?  that seems a LOT easier to hit on both keyboards.
** when set-mark happens, go back to vi-command mode.  b/c pretty sure movement is going to happen right after
** i'd like to be able to copy a region (kill-ring-save) and the region still be selected

** Trying to make Caps_Lock Hyper
clear      lock
clear   control
clear      mod1
clear      mod2
clear      mod3
clear      mod4
clear      mod5
keycode      37 = Hyper_L
keycode      66 = Control_L
add     control = Control_L Control_R
add        mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R Meta_L
add        mod2 = Num_Lock
add        mod3 = Hyper_L
add        mod4 = Super_L Super_R
add        mod5 = Mode_switch ISO_Level3_Shift
** H-k does kill-buffer, H-M-k could do kill-buffer without confirmation?
** 'kill-this-buffer does what I want
** remove saving when switching buffers.  it can get annoying.
** in addition to H-p to toggle previous buffer, do something like H-M-p & H-M-n to cycle up and down ALL active buffers, or H-M-h & H-M-l
** define some key to toggle numbers & symbols
